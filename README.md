Today we are going to work with webapps in our teams.

 # EVERYONE:
 
 If you don't already have a Heroku account, please create a Heroku account on the free tier.
 
 You should NOT need to enter a credit card at any point.
 
 You should be able to do all of the work for this class WITHOUT needing a credit card.  (If you are asked for one, something is wrong---ask for help on Piazza.)
